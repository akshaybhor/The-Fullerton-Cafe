### Summary

Due to the declining business at the Fullerton Café, we have decided to adopt a new business strategy in an effort to improve sales. By focusing on a flywheel strategy that is similar to the one adopted by companies such as Starbucks and Amazon, we will strive for a cycle of continuous improvements and breakthroughs. To do this, we will focus on improving and developing four major areas: a customer loyalty program, a promotional/marketing program, online ordering, and mobile payments. It is our hope that by improving our online and mobile payment systems, as well as partnership with companies such as UberEats and GrubHub that we will be able to increase sales through convenience and ease of access. We also will adopt an IT system to improve inventory management by tracking stock of ingredients and to allow for quick and simple restocking. By implementing an IT system into our business strategy our goal is to adapt the Fullerton Café to a more technologically-advanced world and to once again be a competitor in the neighboring businesses.
